    <h2>What is it all about?</h2>
    <p>If you're a Facebook user you're probably familiar with <em>groups</em>. People often use 
    Facebook's groups to collaborate and share their thoughts. <strong>They also share files</strong>.</p>

    <p>The problem with file sharing is that there are so many services to store files in the cloud,
    so people use all of them. Most often they paste a link to a file in a Facebook post.</p>

    <p><h3>We have the solution!</h3></p>
    <p><strong>Facebook files app</strong> analyzes your groups and all posts, and looks for files.
    It then presents them in a nice way, so you can browse them as in standard file explorer.
    <em>Nice, huh?</em></p>
